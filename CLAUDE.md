# Claude Context for Goverman Project

## Project Overview
**goverman** is a Go version manager that allows installing and managing multiple Go versions on a single system. The project provides a unified tool called `gman` to easily install, uninstall, and switch between different Go versions without affecting the system's default Go installation.

## Key Features
- **Bootstrap Go installation** on fresh systems without requiring Go
- Install multiple Go versions side-by-side using versioned binaries (e.g., `go1.23.9`)
- Two installation methods:
  - **Official**: Uses `go install golang.org/dl/goX.Y.Z@latest` (recommended)
  - **Direct**: Downloads and extracts binary directly from go.dev (fallback for ARM64 issues)
- Set any installed version as the default `go` command
- Automatic PATH setup for different shells (bash, zsh, fish)
- List all installed versions with clear status indicators
- List available versions from go.dev
- Clean uninstall of specific versions or all versions at once
- Handles broken Go installations gracefully

## Technical Implementation
- Single bash script `gman` that handles all operations
- Supports multiple architectures: amd64, arm64, armv6l
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL)
- Detects user's shell and updates appropriate profile files
- Handles both GOBIN and GOPATH configurations
- Creates wrapper scripts for direct installations that set proper GOROOT

## Recent Development History
Based on git commits, we've recently worked on:

1. **PATH Ordering Issues** (commits bb2c258, dd04218)
   - Fixed problems where system or Homebrew Go installations took precedence
   - Ensured goverman-managed versions appear first in PATH
   - Added detection for conflicting Go installations

2. **Default Version Management** (commits de4a622, b368ddd)
   - Implemented `--default` flag during installation
   - Fixed detection of Homebrew Go conflicts
   - Added proper PATH analysis to warn about conflicts

3. **Shell Profile Handling** (commit bb2c258)
   - Fixed PATH exports to append at end of shell profiles
   - Improved shell detection logic
   - Better handling of different shell configurations

4. **Project Refactoring** (commit 25d4c7a)
   - Combined separate install/uninstall scripts into unified `gman` tool
   - Simplified user interface with single entry point

## Current State
- The project has a comprehensive test suite with 7 test scripts
- GitHub Actions CI/CD tests on 12+ OS configurations in parallel
- All major features are implemented and working:
  - Bootstrap installation without requiring Go
  - Official and direct installation methods
  - Version management and switching
  - Bulk uninstall capability
  - Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Edge cases around PATH ordering and shell detection have been addressed
- Handles broken Go installations gracefully
- CI optimized for fast execution (~2 minutes for most platforms)

## Known Issues and Considerations
- When Homebrew Go is installed, PATH ordering can cause conflicts
- The tool offers to fix PATH ordering when conflicts are detected
- Direct installation method is provided as fallback for ARM64 CGO issues

gman bootstrap latest           # Explicitly install latest version
gman bootstrap 1.23.9           # Install specific version

# Install a Go version
gman install latest             # Install latest stable version
gman install 1.23.9 [official|direct] [--default]

# Uninstall versions
gman uninstall 1.23.9           # Remove specific version
gman uninstall-all              # Remove all gman-managed versions

# List versions
gman list                       # List installed versions
gman list-available             # List recent available versions
gman list-available --all       # List all available versions

# Set default version
gman set-default 1.23.9

# Update gman itself
gman-update  # When installed via install.sh

# Check gman version
gman version

# Run tests
